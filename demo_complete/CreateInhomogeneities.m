% CreateInhomogeneities will create a domain to replicate the cross section
% of lungs and heart. Maybe make this a function to be able to select which
% domain we want to test. This script will be useful for performing
% electrode tolerance testing.

% Assign resistivity values, measured in ohm-meters.
% Bone: 150
% Fat: 25
% Muscle: 5
% Blood: 1.5
% Plasma/interstitial fluid: 0.65
% The above values come from the upper arm.
% "Lung resistivity is about five-fold higher than other organs in the
% thorax."
